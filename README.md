Practice machine learning with JavaScript and Plinko. 
# Background
I wanted to do some practical machine learning with K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. Plinko is a game where you drop a ball in the hopes of it reaching the correct bucket with a price. By using KNN you can make predictions on where to drop the ball(s) to ensure you get the right bucket.
